# Doubt 1

# 🔐 What is IAM Access Analyzer?

**IAM Access Analyzer** helps you **identify resources in your AWS account that are accessible from outside your account**.

👉 In simple words:

> It tells you **“Who from outside can access my AWS resources?”**

---

## 🧠 Why AWS Created This Service

In real-world AWS usage:

* Buckets accidentally become public
* IAM policies allow cross-account access
* Roles trust unknown AWS accounts

These are **major security risks**.

IAM Access Analyzer automatically **detects these risks**.

---

## 🔍 What Does It Analyze?

It analyzes **resource-based policies**, such as:

| Service | Example                            |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| S3      | Public / cross-account buckets     |
| IAM     | Roles trusted by external accounts |
| KMS     | Keys usable by other accounts      |
| SQS     | Queues accessible externally       |
| SNS     | Topics open to other accounts      |
| Lambda  | Functions with public permissions  |

❗ It does **NOT** analyze identity-based policies directly.

---

## 🧭 What Is an “Analyzer”?

An **Analyzer** is a configuration that defines:

* **Which boundary to check**
* **What “outside” means**

AWS offers two scopes.

---

# 🟢 Scope: **Account** (what you selected)

### ✅ What it means

> Analyze access **outside THIS AWS account**

It checks:

* ❌ Any resource accessible by **another AWS account**
* ❌ Any resource accessible by **public (anonymous)** users

---

### 📌 Example (Account scope)

You have:

* AWS Account ID: `123456789012`

Access Analyzer will flag:

* S3 bucket accessible by `987654321000`
* IAM role trusted by another account
* Lambda function with `Principal: "*"`

But it will **NOT** flag:

* Access between users/roles **inside the same account**

---

### 👍 When to use Account scope

✔ Single AWS account
✔ Personal / learning
✔ Most common setup
✔ **Default and recommended**

---

# 🔵 Scope: **Organization** (for comparison)

### What it means

> Analyze access outside your **AWS Organization**

* Allows access **within organization accounts**
* Flags access **outside the organization**

Used when:

* Multiple AWS accounts
* AWS Organizations enabled
* Enterprise environments

---

## 🔧 What Happens After You Create an Analyzer?

Once created, it:

1️⃣ Continuously monitors policies
2️⃣ Automatically detects findings
3️⃣ Shows results like:

* **Resource**: S3 bucket
* **External principal**: Public / Account ID
* **Access type**: Read / Write
* **Status**: Active / Resolved

---

## 🚨 Example Finding

> ❗ S3 bucket `user-data-bucket`
> Accessible by **Everyone (Public)**
> Access type: Read

This means:

* Anyone on the internet can read the bucket

---

## 🛠 What You Do With Findings

For each finding, you can:

* ✅ Fix policy (remove public access)
* ✅ Archive finding (if intentional)
* ❌ Ignore (not recommended)

---

## 🎓 Certification & Interview Tip

If asked:

> **“What is IAM Access Analyzer?”**

Best answer:

> “IAM Access Analyzer continuously analyzes resource-based policies to identify unintended external access to AWS resources, helping improve security posture.”

---

## 🧠 One-line Summary

> **IAM Access Analyzer = Security guard that watches for unwanted external access**

# 2nd doubt
# 🔐 AWS Security Group – Inbound Rules Explained

A **Security Group** in AWS acts as a **virtual firewall** for your EC2 instance.
**Inbound rules** control **who is allowed to send traffic INTO the server**.

👉 By default, **everything is blocked** unless you explicitly allow it.

---

## 📋 The Inbound Rules You Added

| Type       | Protocol | Port | Source   |
| ---------- | -------- | ---- | -------- |
| SSH        | TCP      | 22   | My IP    |
| HTTP       | TCP      | 80   | Anywhere |
| HTTPS      | TCP      | 443  | Anywhere |
| Custom TCP | TCP      | 3000 | Anywhere |

Let’s explain **each rule**.

---

## 1️⃣ SSH — Port 22 — My IP

### 🔧 What it is

* **SSH (Secure Shell)** allows you to **log into the EC2 instance** from your local machine.

### 🔐 Why “My IP”

* Restricts access to **only your current public IP**
* Prevents:

  * Brute-force attacks
  * Unauthorized server access

### ✅ Best Practice

✔ Always restrict SSH
❌ Never allow SSH from `0.0.0.0/0` in production

📌 This rule is **only for administrators**, not users.

---

## 2️⃣ HTTP — Port 80 — Anywhere

### 🔧 What it is

* Allows **unsecured web traffic**
* Used for:

  * Public websites
  * REST APIs
  * Health checks

### 🌍 Why “Anywhere”

* Anyone on the internet can access your server on port 80

📌 Common for:

* Initial testing
* Redirecting HTTP → HTTPS

---

## 3️⃣ HTTPS — Port 443 — Anywhere

### 🔧 What it is

* Allows **secure encrypted web traffic**
* Uses **TLS/SSL**

### 🔐 Why this is important

* Protects:

  * User data
  * Login credentials
  * API payloads

### ✅ Industry standard

✔ Public HTTPS access
✔ Mandatory for production apps

---

## 4️⃣ Custom TCP — Port 3000 — Anywhere

### 🔧 What it is

* Opens port **3000** for your **Node.js backend**
* Express apps commonly run on:

  ```
  http://localhost:3000
  ```

### 🌍 Why “Anywhere”

* Allows:

  * Frontend apps
  * API testing tools (Postman)
  * Browsers

### ⚠️ Important Note

This is **temporary**.

#### In real production:

* Node.js runs on **3000 internally**
* Nginx / Load Balancer exposes **80/443**
* Port 3000 is **not publicly open**

---

## 🔁 How Traffic Flows (Real-world)

```
User Browser
   ↓
Internet
   ↓
EC2 Security Group (Inbound Rules)
   ↓
Node.js App (Port 3000)
```

---

## 🛡 Security Group Characteristics (Must Know)

✔ **Stateful** – return traffic is automatically allowed
✔ Only **ALLOW rules** (no deny rules)
✔ Evaluated as a whole (order doesn’t matter)

---

## 🎓 Interview-Ready Explanation

> “These inbound rules allow secure administrative access via SSH restricted to my IP, public web traffic over HTTP/HTTPS, and temporary public access to a Node.js backend running on port 3000. This setup follows least-privilege for SSH and open access only where required.”

---

## 🚨 Security Warning (Important)

For production:

* ❌ Do not expose port 3000
* ❌ Do not open SSH to Anywhere
* ✔ Use Load Balancer + HTTPS
* ✔ Use IAM roles instead of passwords

---

## 🧠 One-line Summary

> **Inbound rules define who can talk to your EC2 instance and on which ports**

---




## 🔍 Why “Custom TCP”?

### Short answer:

> **AWS doesn’t know what application runs on port 3000**, so you must define it manually as **Custom TCP**.

---

## 🧠 How AWS thinks about traffic

AWS Security Groups don’t understand:

* Node.js
* Express
* React
* APIs

They only understand:

* **Protocols** (TCP / UDP / ICMP)
* **Port numbers**

---

## 🧩 Predefined vs Custom Rules

### 🔵 Predefined rule (Example: SSH)

When you select:

```
Type: SSH
```

AWS automatically fills:

* Protocol: TCP
* Port: 22

Because **SSH is a standard protocol**.

---

### 🟠 Custom TCP rule

When you select:

```
Type: Custom TCP
Port: 3000
```

You are saying:

> “Allow **any TCP-based application** running on **port 3000**”

AWS doesn’t care *what* that app is.

---

## 🚀 Why Node.js uses Custom TCP

Node.js / Express:

* Uses **raw TCP sockets**
* Listens on any port you choose (3000, 4000, 8080, etc.)
* Has **no fixed standard port**

So AWS cannot label it as:

* HTTP
* HTTPS
* SSH

➡️ Therefore: **Custom TCP**

---

## 📦 What “Custom TCP” actually means

| Field     | Meaning                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Custom    | User-defined                        |
| TCP       | Reliable, connection-based protocol |
| Port 3000 | App is listening here               |

So the rule means:

> “Allow inbound TCP traffic on port 3000 from anywhere”

---

## 🔐 Why not HTTP instead of Custom TCP?

You *could* select:

```
Type: HTTP
Port: 80
```

But:

* Your app is **not listening on port 80**
* It’s listening on **3000**
* HTTP ≠ port number (AWS binds HTTP to port 80)

AWS won’t let you say:

```
HTTP on port 3000
```

So you must use **Custom TCP**.

---

## 🎯 Real-world analogy

Think of:

* **SSH** = a well-known door (keyed, labeled)
* **HTTP/HTTPS** = main entrance doors
* **Custom TCP** = “Side door I built myself”

AWS says:

> “Okay, tell me which door number and protocol.”

---

## 🎓 Interview-level answer

If asked:

> **Why did you use Custom TCP for port 3000?**

Answer:

> “Port 3000 is used by a custom Node.js application which doesn’t map to a predefined AWS service. Since it communicates over TCP on a non-standard port, we configure it as a Custom TCP inbound rule.”

---

## 🧠 One-line takeaway

> **Custom TCP = ‘Allow any application that uses TCP on this port’**

---

Great question — this shows you’re moving from **“using the internet” to “understanding how it works”** 👍
I’ll explain this **cleanly, layered, and exam/interview-ready**.

---

## 🌐 Where TCP & UDP Sit (Context First)

TCP and UDP are **Transport Layer protocols**.

Internet protocols are organized in **layers** (TCP/IP model):

```
Application
Transport   ← TCP, UDP live here
Internet
Network Access
```

So “other protocols” exist at **different layers**.

---

# 🔵 TRANSPORT LAYER (besides TCP & UDP)

### 1️⃣ **SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)**

* Reliable like TCP
* Message-based (not byte stream)
* Used in **telecom systems (VoIP, 4G/5G signaling)**

📌 Rare in web apps

---

### 2️⃣ **QUIC**

* Built on **UDP**
* Used by **HTTP/3**
* Faster connection setup
* Encrypted by default

📌 Used by:

* Google
* YouTube
* Modern browsers

---

# 🟢 INTERNET / NETWORK LAYER PROTOCOLS

### 3️⃣ **IP (Internet Protocol)**

* Handles **addressing & routing**
* IPv4 / IPv6

📌 TCP & UDP cannot work without IP

---

### 4️⃣ **ICMP**

* Error reporting & diagnostics
* Used by:

  * `ping`
  * `traceroute`

📌 Example:

```
Destination unreachable
```

---

### 5️⃣ **IPsec**

* Secure IP communication
* Encrypts packets at network layer
* Used in **VPNs**

---

# 🟡 APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOLS (Very Important)

These run **on top of TCP or UDP**.

### 6️⃣ **HTTP / HTTPS**

* Web communication
* APIs, browsers

Runs on:

* TCP (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2)
* QUIC (HTTP/3)

---

### 7️⃣ **FTP / SFTP**

* File transfer
* SFTP runs over SSH (TCP)

---

### 8️⃣ **SMTP / POP3 / IMAP**

* Email protocols

---

### 9️⃣ **DNS**

* Domain → IP resolution
* Uses:

  * UDP (fast)
  * TCP (large responses)

---

### 🔟 **SSH**

* Secure remote login
* Runs on TCP (port 22)

---

# 🟣 LINK / NETWORK ACCESS LAYER

### 1️⃣1️⃣ **ARP**

* Maps IP → MAC address
* Used inside local networks

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ **Ethernet**

* Physical data transmission
* LAN communication

---

# 🧠 Simple Mental Map

```
User opens website
↓
HTTP (Application)
↓
TCP / QUIC (Transport)
↓
IP (Internet)
↓
Ethernet / Wi-Fi
```

---

## 🎓 Interview Gold Answer

If asked:

> **What other protocols exist besides TCP and UDP?**

Say:

> “At the transport layer, protocols like SCTP and QUIC exist. At the internet layer, IP and ICMP handle routing and diagnostics. At the application layer, protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP, SMTP, and SSH operate on top of TCP or UDP.”

---

## 🧠 One-line takeaway

> **TCP & UDP carry data — other protocols define how data is addressed, secured, and used**

✅ Backend successfully deployed on AWS.

---

# 🧠 WHAT YOU ACHIEVED (VERY IMPORTANT)

You now understand:

* EC2 launch (latest UI)
* Security groups
* IAM roles vs access keys
* SSH access
* Real backend deployment


---
---

# STEP 2️⃣ — VERIFY RDS CONNECTIVITY FROM EC2
- 1. Go to EC2 terminal
```bash
sudo yum install -y mysql 
#  Installs the MySQL client utility, which allows your EC2 instance to:
    #Connect to MySQL databases
    #Send SQL commands
    #Test database access
    # note mysql is now not supported , install mariadb105 instead of mysql , it is fully compatible with rds mysql

# This does NOT install MySQL server.
# It only installs the client tool.
```

- 2. Connect to RDS
```bash
mysql -h RDS_ENDPOINT -u admin -p  # This command opens a direct TCP connection from: EC2 → RDS MySQL database
```
| Flag           | Meaning                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `mysql`        | Start MySQL client           |
| `-h`           | Hostname (RDS endpoint)      |
| `RDS_ENDPOINT` | DNS name of RDS instance     |
| `-u`           | Database username            |
| `admin`        | Master DB user               |
| `-p`           | Prompt for password securely |

What happens behind the scenes

1️⃣ EC2 resolves RDS_ENDPOINT to an IP
2️⃣ TCP connection is attempted on port 3306
3️⃣ RDS security group checks inbound rules
4️⃣ Authentication happens
5️⃣ MySQL shell opens

- Enter password.

- If you see:
```bash
mysql>
```

- ✅ EC2 ↔ RDS connectivity works.

- STEP 3️⃣ — CREATE USERS TABLE

```
Inside MySQL:

CREATE DATABASE smart_appointments;

USE smart_appointments;

CREATE TABLE users (
  id CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255),
  role ENUM('USER','ADMIN'),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);


Exit:

exit;
```

---

- Create dynamo db Appointments
- verify connection in ec2 
```bash
aws dynamodb list-tables

```
- You should see: Appointments

- This confirms IAM Role is working

PHASE 5.1 — RUN NODE APP PROPERLY (PM2)
❓ Why this is needed (very important)

Right now, if:

SSH session closes ❌

EC2 restarts ❌

App crashes ❌

👉 Your server stops

In industry:

Backend must never stop
---
WHAT IS PM2 (IN SIMPLE WORDS)

PM2 is:

A process manager

Keeps Node app running

Restarts app if it crashes

Starts app on EC2 reboot

Almost every Node backend on EC2 uses this

---
STEP 5.1.1 — INSTALL PM2 ON EC2

SSH into EC2:

**npm install -g pm2**


Verify:

**pm2 -v**
🔧 STEP 5.1.2 — START YOUR APP USING PM2

Go to your backend project folder:

cd <your-project-folder>


Start app (replace entry file if different):

**pm2 start src/index.js --name smart-appointment-api**

| Part                    | Meaning                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `pm2 start`             | Tell PM2 to start managing a process |
| `src/index.js`          | Entry point of Node app              |
| `--name`                | Assign a readable name               |
| `smart-appointment-api` | App identifier inside PM2            |

What PM2 does internally:

Starts Node app in background

Detaches from SSH terminal

Tracks:

CPU usage

Memory usage

Crashes

Registers app inside PM2 registry

Now:
👉 Closing SSH will NOT stop the app


You should see:

App smart-appointment-api started

🔧 STEP 5.1.3 — VERIFY APP STATUS
pm2 list


Status should be:

online

🔧 STEP 5.1.4 — SAVE PM2 CONFIG (VERY IMPORTANT)

This ensures auto-restart after EC2 reboot.

**pm2 save**

Why this is critical:

PM2 stores:

List of running apps

App names

Entry files

Configs

This creates a dump file used on reboot.

Without this:
❌ Apps won’t restart after EC2 reboot


Then:

**pm2 startup**

What this does:

Generates a system startup script

Integrates PM2 with Linux boot process

Tells OS:

“Start PM2 when server boots”


PM2 will print a command like:

sudo env PATH=...


👉 Copy and run that exact command

🧪 STEP 5.1.5 — TEST PROPERLY

Stop your SSH session

Hit API via Postman:

http://EC2_PUBLIC_IP:3000/api/auth/register


✅ If it works → PM2 is doing its job

🧠 INDUSTRY CHECKPOINT (IMPORTANT)

At this point:

App runs independently of SSH ✅

App survives crashes ✅

App restarts on reboot ✅

This is production behavior
